## How to run:

- `make` to compile all files
- `make q1` to run Peterson’s solution and multithreading design.
- `make q2` to run Peterson’s solution and fork with shared memory design.
- `make q3` to run semaphore and multithreading design
- `make q4` to run semaphore and multithreading design
- `make clean` to clean up the output files

## Discussion

### 1. Program output for Peterson’s solution and multithreading design (Problem #1)

### Notes:

- File naming convention:
   1. `q1.c, q2.c, q3.c, q4.c` source code, each number corresponding to the question number in the assignment.
   2. `makefile` the makefile
   3. `README.md` what you're reading right now
   4. `shubert.c` the Shubert function, given with the assignment; modified into dependency
